# D3 + React Starter Template

When you have an idea and a data set ready to visualize, you are eager to go! Unfortunately, a lot of setup is required before React renders your visualization.Â This template tries to bulldoze as many of the hurdles ahead, so you can more easily express the ideas you want to share.

In this README you will find sections for:

- Installation
- Credits

## Installation

If you don't already have these you will want to install:

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Node and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

With those applications, extension, and CLIs installed you can clone this repository to your local machine and run `yarn` to install the dependancies.

## Getting Started

After running `yarn` to install all of the dependancies, you can run `yarn run dev` to spin up your dev server. You should now be able to open the app in your browser at this URL `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`

Vite will handle the hot module reloading to keep what you're looking at in sync with the code you are writting.

### Additional Scripts

Besides the development script, there are many more scripts set up:

- `build` - Create production build
- `preview` - Create a [preview](https://vitejs.dev/config/preview-options.html) of the app to share
- `format` - Fix formatting issues with Prettier
- `lint` - Fix minor JavaScript issues with ESLint
