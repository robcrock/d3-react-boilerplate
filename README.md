# D3 + React Starter Template

When you have an idea and a data set ready to visualize, you are eager to go! Unfortunately, a lot of setup is required before React renders your visualization.Â This template tries to bulldoze as many of the hurdles ahead, so you can more easily express the ideas you want to share.
<br></br>

## Getting Started

After running `yarn` to install all of the dependancies, you can run `yarn run dev` to spin up your dev server. You should now be able to open the app in your browser at this URL `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`

Vite will handle the hot module reloading to keep what you're looking at in sync with the code you are writing.
<br></br>

### Prerequisites

If you don't already have these you will want to install:

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Node and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

With those applications, extension, and CLIs all installed you're ready to go. Clone this repository to your local machine, change into that directory and run `yarn` to install all of the project dependancies.
<br></br>

## Features

One of the main motives behind this project was saving you time with the setup. That's because there is a good amount of it to stand up a proper repo for this kind of work. Of course, we could have excluded certain things to make the repository leaner, but I am erring on the side of adding more to improve the developer experience even further.

What's currently included:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Modern bundler
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Static Type Analysis
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Code formatter
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) - Quickly find problems in your JavaScript
- [Charkra](https://chakra-ui.com/) - Component Library
- [React Query](https://react-query-v3.tanstack.com/) - Data synchronization for React
- [D3](https://d3js.org/) - The de facto data visualization library for JavaScript
- [React](reactjs.org) - JavaScript Library for building UIs

Just let me know what else you would like me to add and I'll look into it.
<br></br>

## Scripts

Besides the development script `yarn run dev`, there are many more scripts set up:

- `build` - Create production build
- `preview` - Create a [preview](https://vitejs.dev/config/preview-options.html) of the app to share
- `format` - Fix formatting issues with Prettier
- `lint` - Fix minor JavaScript issues with ESLint
